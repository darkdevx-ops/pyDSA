# 1. Singly Linked List :

-- The 1st program or code is for implementation of singly linked list using Python.
-- I have created two different class in this, 1 for creating a Node and another 1 for managing node using some function.
-- Functions are
-- 1. insertionAtBeg(value) :- this function is used to add node at the begining of linked list.
--- eg. insertionAtBeg(10) >>> 10
-- 2. insertionAtEnd(value) :- this function is used to add node at the end of linked list.
--- eg. insertionAtEnd(20) >>> 10 20
-- 3. insertionAtMid(value, location) :- this function is used to add node at the middle of linked list based on the given location(value of a node already present in linked list) else it add the node at the end of linked list by default.
--- eg. insertionAtMid(15,30) >>> 10 20 15
-- 4. deleteNode(value) :- this function is used to delete a node based on the value of the node from the linked list.
--- eg. deleteNode(20) >>> 10 15
-- 5. printNode() :- this function is used to print the nodes of linked list.
